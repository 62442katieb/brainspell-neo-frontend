	<p>
	Brainspell-neo is the tool to help you do prepare your collection of articles for meta-analyses. 
	No more "what was the exact exclusion / inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis" ? 
	All the metadata needed to reproduce the analysis should be available and sharable. Also, do you need to collaborate ? Brainspell-neo is there for you. 
	</p>

	<p>
	This project started with Brainspell (by Roberto Toro, building on NeuroSynth) a long time ago ... and then evolved to be specifically tuned for neuroimaging meta-analyses. A lot of work was done on the backend by Neel and Sharabesh at Berkeley, and a lot of work was done on the front end by Anisha and Katie, and more are now joining and making sure that this is going to be useful. 
	</p>

Brainspell-neo has linked to projects that do the actual analysis,
