### Getting started

First make sure you have [`npm` and `node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed

Next, clone the boilerplate from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akeshavan/vue-auth-boilerplate
```

Then install all `npm` packages:

```bash
cd vue-auth-boilerplate/my-app
npm install
```

To run the app, do:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or wherever npm starts the server). As you make changes to your app, the browser will reload so you don't have to keep refreshing the page.
